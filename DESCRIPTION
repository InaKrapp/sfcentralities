Description: The geometric median is a point minimizing straight-line distances
    to a given set of points. For a point dataset given as sf, this package allows
    its quick and efficient computation.
    Central points based on street networks can also be computed easily. If the 
    user does not supply a street network, it will be automatically downloaded from 
    Openstreetmap.
